## Synopsis

Responsive website created with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery for Red Academy's Web Development Program.



## Difficulties & Personal Learnings

A lot of difficulty was encountered with the positioning of items on the page.  Lots of trial and error was experienced, but in the end managed to get everything in the right spots.  Also encountered issues with Sass and Gulp not functionning properly and so far have been unable to resolve the issue.
